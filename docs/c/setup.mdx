# Setting up for speedruns

All the information needed to set up the PC version of Carbon for speedruns.

## Game version

A **1.4 version** of the game is preferred, which can be found very easily on the internet. Alternatively, the **1.2 version** of the game can be an option **but** i did not try to do any FG run so far. The language does not matter except Chinese (both <ins>Traditional</ins> and <ins>Simplified</ins>), Japanese, Korean, Thai and Russian. Those requires the **1.3 version of the game with their own executable**. Only English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Russian and Japanese have a dubbing, others use the English one.

### Console ?

Console versions have inconsistent framerates, more loading screens, longer load times and lower accessibility. It would be shooting yourself in the foot running on console.

## Validating your installation

Make sure the intro videos and cutscenes play correctly. Invalid installations with missing or broken videos are not allowed. For example, when you launch the game, after the very short loading screen, if you are automatically sent to the splashscreen (the `Press START to begin` screen), your installation is invalid.

    </div>
</details>

Make sure that the game music, sound effects, assets all play and appear correctly. Modified installations are not allowed. For more information, read [the Game rules from speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/nfsc?h=Career_Any-NG&rules=game&x=xd1olzk8-jlz94y82.jqzg5e4l).

### Collector's Edition

The version of your game has to be the Collector's Edition. It enables additional content and **grants you extra cash when you start a new career (10000 $)**.  
Most of the games wandering on the internet are Collector's Edition since it is the most stable and up to date.
