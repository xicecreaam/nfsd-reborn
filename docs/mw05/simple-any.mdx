# Simple Career Any% guide

The perfect route to start your speedrunning journey.

## Lapglitch

Start the run by lapglitching circuits **C14**, **C1**, **C2** & **C3**. You can press LB/L1 to lapglitch **C14** faster, depending if you're using an XInput or a DSX controller. Then, RB/R1 or LB/L1 twice to lapglitch C1, C2 & C3.

## Prologue

Watch the absolute cutscene banger and when you gain control of the BMW, use full NOS and go as fast as possible until Mia calls you regarding a mysterious oil leak on your ride.

Complete Ronnie and Bull sprints. Then, you will face Roger (aka Rog) with 2 unique opponents. This race is fully scripted and the opponents, besides their names, will always have the same cars. Usually, after this race you have a cutscene involving Razor and you but you can **skip this cutscene very easily**. The moment you cross the finish line, **restart the race** then open the menu, quit back to main menu and go into career again. This glitch will skip the cutscene and will send you directly to Razor sprint.

During Razor sprint, at around 73% of the track, Mia calls you to warn you about an oil leak you left at the starting line. Your BMW has been sabotaged and you will lose the race, resulting in the loss of your car. Then, after the cutscene you will be asked to choose a new car. Choose the Golf (4th car). You will then spawn outside and Mia will ask you to go to your *Safe house*.

#### Remarks

Rog circuit race is "*unlapglitchable*" since it's not available in Quick Race. Plus, it has a unique hex address.

After buying the Golf, while driving to the *Safe house*, turn right where the path splits despite the arrow telling you to go left.

## Sonny

Do *Race 1* from the *Safe house*. After finishing the race, turn around and go to the performance shop. Install any *spoiler* you want and *Race Engine*.  
Do *Race 2*. Once at the stadium, at around 51% of the race, press start and tune *Aerodynamics* to `+5`. After the race, start a chase manually from *Bounty 2*.

<font color="red">**Don't boss skip !**</font> Just spam your Confirm button (A or X). You can use the mouse too. Choose *2 random markers* and confirm to move on to the next boss.

## Taz

At this point, there are 2 possible scenarios here :

* **Scenario 1 — You got the cash marker (with or without Sonny's pinkslip / car).**

    Upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.  
    Do *Camera 1*. **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**  

* **Scenario 2 — You got Sonny's pinkslip / car only.**

    Go back to the *Safe house* and sell Sonny's car.  
    Lapglitch circuits **C4** & **C5**.  
    Quit to free roam, go to the performance shop to your right and upgrade *Race Transmission*, *Pro Suspension* and *Pro NOS*.

#### The following route is the same for each scenario.

Do *Camera 1*. **(150 km/h | 93 mph)**  
Start *Race 4*. During this race, after the 2 small S corners, tune *Handling* to `-1`, *Ride Height* to `+5` and *NOS* to `+2`.  
Do *Race 3* from the *Safe house*. If you trigger the cops in the race, finish the race without losing them. Then, continue forwards to the stadium and kill everybody chasing you with the stadium pursuit breaker. Escape on the **same hiding spot** as on Sonny.  
If you don't get cops during *Race 3*, do a manual chase from *Bounty 2* instead and do the following chase. You would also do *Camera 2* **(145 km/h | 90 mph)** during this chase.
