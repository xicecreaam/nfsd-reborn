# Intermediate Career Any% guide

A route designed for those who have mastered the basics and want to optimize their runs.

## Prerequisite before starting

If you discover this route, you are surely a player who is now more comfortable with the game. If this is not the case, you must go through the “Beginners route".  
In any case, we are going to make things a little more challenging and simplify some words / expressions to give a "more experienced" approach.

|   Word / Expression   |     Abbreviation      |
|:---------------------:|:---------------------:|
| Safe house            | **SH**                |
| Quick Escape          | **QE**                |
| Camera                | **Cam**               |
| Taz manual chase      | **Taz cure**          |
| Roadblock             | **Block**             |
| Cost to state         | **CTS**               |
| Bounty                | **฿**                 |
| Circuit Cx, Cy, ...   | **Cx**, **Cy**, ...   |
| Lap knockout KOx, ... | **KOx**, **KOy**, ... |

## Prologue

Start the run by lapglitching **C14**, **C1**, **C2** and **C3**. You can press LB/L1 to lapglitch **C14** faster, depending if you're using an XInput or a DSX controller. Then, RB/R1 or LB/L1 twice to lapglitch **C1**, **C2** and **C3**.
